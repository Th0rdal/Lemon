updates must be in a specific form to work.
you need to create a new object with has a keyword as key and then the actual data as value:
e.g.:
    {$push: {"username":"newUsername"}}

keywords:
    $set: replace old value with new
    $push: add to array
    $addToSet: same as push, but only if the element is not already in the array
    $pop: remove first or last element from array
    $pull: removes all matching values from the array
